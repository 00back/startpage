# 00back's startpage
This is a custom startpage for your browser and it has only been tested with 
Firefox. Features include duckduckgo search engine, youtube search through invivious, bookmarks and it can also read rss 
feeds. It is minimal in design and the javascript, css and html is just one 
single file. It also contains a sample image i found on the internet.

## Usage
Press the tab key or click the text indicating what tab you are on to switch between tabs and use the down and up arrows or click the youtube or websearch button to switch between searching duckduckgo and invidous (invidious instance is hardcoded and is currently set to the most popular invidous instance, this will likely change sometime I think).
