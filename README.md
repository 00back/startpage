# 00back's startpage
This is a custom startpage for your browser and it has only been tested with 
Firefox. Features include duckduckgo search engine, bookmarks and it can also read rss 
feeds. It is very minimal in design and the javascript, css and html is just one 
single file. It also contains a sample image i found on the internet.

# Usage
Press the tab key to switch between tabs and use the down and up arrows to switch between searching duckduckgo and invidous (instance is hardcoded and is currently set to the most popular invidous instance, this will likely change sometime I think)
